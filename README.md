# sage-template-update

Synchronize git templates generated by GitHub as if they were forks.

```bash
npx sage-template-update <source-template-repo-url>
```
on an child instance of a Github template repository will open up an interactive CLI where you can select from a list of updated commits that have been made after child instance creation. These will then be applied to the child template instance keeping changes and patches current.

All working directory changes will be stashed before any operations are made using git and popped once successfully completed. This is for your own peace-of-mind and protection. If any operation fails, simply use `git stash pop` to retrieve your cwd again.

Special treatment will be given to source commits with messages formatted: `Bump <package> from <src_version> to <dst_version>`. These commits will call `yarn` to update `<package>` to version `<dst_version>`.
